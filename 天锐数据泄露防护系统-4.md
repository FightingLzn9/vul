# SQL Injection Vulnerability in the findModulePage.do Interface of Tipray Data Leakage Prevention System

## Basic Overview
We have already learned about some basic information of the system developer and the reasons for authentication bypass in https://github.com/FightingLzn9/vul/blob/main/%E5%A4%A9%E9%94%90%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E6%B3%84%E9%9C%B2%E9%98%B2%E6%8A%A4%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F-1.md.

To reduce your review burden, we will not repeat the details in this report.

## Vulnerability Analysis
We found a sink point in `com.trwfe.controller.MenuController#findModulePage`.

Based on our analysis in the first report, the `PageVo` class is insecure and its parameters are user-controllable. Letâ€™s continue to trace further.

Trace down to the mapper layer.

The use of `${` leads to SQL injection.

The following POC can be constructed for verification:
```

The time-delay injection was successfully triggered. The `findModulePage.do` interface has an SQL injection vulnerability.

Thank you for your review. Wish you a pleasant day!
