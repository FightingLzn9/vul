# SQL Injection Vulnerability in the findSingConfigPage.do Interface of Tipray Data Leakage Prevention System

## Basic Overview
We have already learned about some basic information of the system developer and the reasons for authentication bypass in https://github.com/FightingLzn9/vul/blob/main/%E5%A4%A9%E9%94%90%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E6%B3%84%E9%9C%B2%E9%98%B2%E6%8A%A4%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F-1.md.

To reduce your review burden, we will not repeat the details in this report.

## Vulnerability Analysis
We identified a sink point in `com.trwfe.controller.ThirdSystemConfigController#findRolePage`.

Based on the analysis in the first report, we know that the `PageVo` class is insecure, and **all its parameters are controllable by users**.

We continue to trace the `findAllSingConfigPage` method here.

Eventually, we can reach the mapper layer. Here, the `${` syntax is used, and the internal parameters are controllableâ€”this leads to SQL injection.

Based on this, the following Proof of Concept (PoC) can be constructed:

The request successfully caused a delay, confirming that the `findSingConfigPage.do` interface has an SQL injection vulnerability.

Thank you for your review. Wish you a pleasant day!
