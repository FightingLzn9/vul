# SQL Injection Vulnerability in the findTenantPage.do Interface of Tipray Data Leakage Prevention System

## Basic Overview
We have already learned about some basic information of the system developer and the reasons for authentication bypass in https://github.com/FightingLzn9/vul/blob/main/%E5%A4%A9%E9%94%90%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E6%B3%84%E9%9C%B2%E9%98%B2%E6%8A%A4%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F-1.md.

To reduce your review burden, we will not repeat the details in this report.

## Vulnerability Analysis
We found a sink point in `com.trwfe.controller.InvokerController#findTenantPage`. As stated in our previous report, we know that the `PageVo` class is insecure and its parameters are user-controllable.

Letâ€™s continue to trace further.

Here, direct parameter concatenation leads to injection.

Based on this, we constructed the payload:

```

The injection was successfully triggered, resulting in a 4-second delay.
