# SQL Injection Vulnerability in Tipray Data Leakage Prevention System
## Basic Overview
We have already learned about some basic information of the system developer and the reasons for authentication bypass in https://github.com/FightingLzn9/vul/blob/main/%E5%A4%A9%E9%94%90%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E6%B3%84%E9%9C%B2%E9%98%B2%E6%8A%A4%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F-1.md.

To reduce your review burden, we will not repeat the details in this report.

## Vulnerability Analysis
We found a sink point in `com.trwfe.controller.RoleController#findRolePage`.

This uses the `PageVo` class. As we know from the previous reports, this class is insecure and its parameters are user-controllable.

Letâ€™s trace the `findAllPage` method here.

Move down to the mapper layer.

Based on this, the following POC is constructed:
```

The time-delay injection was successfully triggered. Therefore, the `findRolePage.do` interface has an SQL injection vulnerability.

Thank you for your review. Wish you a pleasant day!
